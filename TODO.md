# ðŸ›  TODOs and Ideas

- [ ] Revisit model tuning with ensemble stacking
- [ ] Calibrate probabilities (e.g. with Platt scaling)
- [ ] Add cross-validation for more robust scoring
- [ ] Improve frontend interactivity later (drag & drop team builder?)
- [ ] Recompute_features, predict_cli, config.py still have issues
