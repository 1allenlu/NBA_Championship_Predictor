# ðŸ›  TODOs and Ideas

- [ ] Revisit model tuning with ensemble stacking
- [ ] Calibrate probabilities (e.g. with Platt scaling)
- [ ] Add cross-validation for more robust scoring
- [ ] Improve frontend interactivity later (drag & drop team builder?)
- [ ] Recompute_features, predict_cli, config.py still have issues

xgboost_smote my best model  


frontend: 
- shows the bar of remaining salary cap 
- if remaining cap is positive the text is black which is not visible since the background is also black 
- should be a better way to find a player for users: maybe allow them to pick the team first and then the players.
